        Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
        Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
        Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
        Or bends with the remover to remove.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br>
        That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
        It is the star to every wandering bark,<br>
        Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
        Within his bending sickle's compass come:<br>
        Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
        But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        If this be error and upon me proved,<br>
        I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
